Here will be the super-useful user guide to the meteoland app, stay tuned!

\newpage

## General info

This app is intended as an useful example of the `meteoland` package capabilities,
and is limited to the Catalonian area, as the servers space is limited and we can
not have all the station data from around the world.  
If you want to interpolate metereological variables from another area yo can use
the `meteoland` package, given that metereological data and/or climate model projections
are available for you. See the package user guide to know how!  

# Getting started

Whatever you want to do, interpolate current year or historical dates,
interpolate and downscale future projection based on climate models... we have
a mode for you:

  1. **Historical Points mode**  
  1. **Current Points mode**  
  1. **Projection Points mode**  
  1. **Historical Grid mode**  
  1. **Current Grid mode**  
  1. **Projection Grid mode**

\newpage

## **Historical Points mode**

In this mode you will be able to select up to ten points by coordinates
(latitude and longitude) and a range of dates between 1976 and the last year
(2016 at the moment of writing this guide) and retrieve the interpolated data
from those points for that period, based on the available metereological stations
data around the selected points.

### Data input

  1. Go to the `USER INPUT` tab  
  1. Select `Historical` and `Points` in the left sidebar  
  1. Introduce the starting and ending dates of the period of interest (if you
     want to retrieve only one day, starting and ending date must be the same)  
  1. Select the points, as coordinates. You can do this in two ways:
      - Clicking in the map at the desired coordinates. You will see that 
        clicked points are added to the `selected points` list  
      - Filling the `Latitude` and `Longitude` boxes with the desired coordinates
        and clicking in `Append coordinates` button. Again, you will see that the
        `selected points` list will be updated  
  1. If you want to clear the coordinates introduced, click the `Reset coordinates`
     button. This will clear all coordinates and you will have to start again  
  1. After you have introduced all the points, click in the `Go` button and the
     app will start to process the coordinates and will show the results in the
     `DATA OUTPUT` tab  

![Introducing parameters in the historical points mode](resources/historical_points_mode_01.png)

### Data output

After clicking the `Go` button, app view will change to the `DATA OUTPUT` tab,
showing the progress of the interpolation process. Be warned that it can take
a while to process the data, depending on the date range and the number of points.  
When the process is finished, a visual report will appear in the `DATA OUTPUT`
tab, showing the time series of the temperature, humidity, precipitation and
PET values. You will be able to change between the selected points and also you
can zoom in/out in the time series visualization. The topographic information
of the point is also showed.  
You can retrieve the processed data by clicking in the `Download` button. This
will download a `zip` file containing the `txt` files with the data for each
selected point.  

![Progress dialogue](resources/historical_points_mode_02.png)  

![Data output overview](resources/historical_points_mode_03.png)  

### Limitations

  1. Point selection limited to 10 points  
  1. Dates range limited from 1976-01-01 to 2016-12-01

Also, if you want all the historical period in ten different points, it will
take some minutes to process the data, so you can slack off a little ;)

![Ecologists working hard (modified from https://xkcd.com/303/)](resources/compiling_scaled.png)

### What's happening behind the curtains?

In this mode we load a calibrated dataset
from all AEMET metereological stations (built with the
`meteoland::interpolation.calibration` function) and interpolate the data for the
coordinates selected using the `meteoland::interpolationpoints` function.
For that we need both the stations and the points topographies, loaded as
`SpatialTopographyPoints` objects.  

\newpage

## **Current Points mode**

Here you will be able to interpolate data from the current year up to the actual
date, based on the available metereological stations data around the selected
points.  

### Data input

  1. Go to the `USER INPUT` tab  
  1. Select `Current` and `Points` in the left sidebar  
  1. Introduce the starting and ending dates of the period of interest (if you
     want to retrieve only one day, starting and ending date must be the same)  
  1. Select the points, as coordinates. You can do this in two ways:
      - Clicking in the map at the desired coordinates. You will see that 
        clicked points are added to the `selected points` list  
      - Filling the `Latitude` and `Longitude` boxes with the desired coordinates
        and clicking in `Append coordinates` button. Again, you will see that the
        `selected points` list will be updated  
  1. If you want to clear the coordinates introduced, click the `Reset coordinates`
     button. This will clear all coordinates and you will have to start again  
  1. After you have introduced all the points, click in the `Go` button and the
     app will start to process the coordinates and will show the results in the
     `DATA OUTPUT` tab  

![Introducing parameters in the current points mode](resources/current_points_mode_01.png)

### Data output

In this mode app view also will change to the `DATA OUTPUT` tab automatically after
pressing the `Go` button. Usually this mode is faster in processing the data as
the time span is one year as maximum (No slack off time in this mode).  
When the process is finished a visual report similar to the one we saw for the
previuos mode is presented, showing the time series of the temperature, humidity, precipitation and
PET values. You will be able to change between the selected points and also you
can zoom in/out in the time series visualization. The topographic information
of the point is also showed.  
You can retrieve the processed data by clicking in the `Download` button. This
will download a `zip` file containing the `txt` files with the data for each
selected point.  

![Current points mode data output overview](resources/current_points_mode_02.png)

### Limitations

  1. Point selection limited to 10 points  
  1. Dates ranges limited to the available current year dates

### What's happening behind the curtains?

Similar to the *Historical Points mode*, an interpolation object is created for
the dates range provided, and the interpolation parameters are loaded (as they
are pre-calculated). After that, the datta is interpolated using the
`meteoland::interpolationpoints` function and the data is returned as a
`SpatialMetereologyPoints` object to visualize.

\newpage

## **Projection Points mode**

In this case data are interpolated and downscaled from coarse
climate models projections (using both, historical and future data and including
a statistical correction) to the selected points scale.  

### Data input

  1. Go to the `USER INPUT` tab  
  1. Select `Projection` and `Points` in the left sidebar  
  1. Select the desired combination of `Regional Climate Model` and
     `Representative Concentration Pathway`. In this case there is no date
     selection as all the future projection until 2100-12-01 is retrieved  
  1. Select the points, as coordinates. You can do this in two ways:
      - Clicking in the map at the desired coordinates. You will see that 
        clicked points are added to the `selected points` list  
      - Filling the `Latitude` and `Longitude` boxes with the desired coordinates
        and clicking in `Append coordinates` button. Again, you will see that the
        `selected points` list will be updated  
  1. If you want to clear the coordinates introduced, click the `Reset coordinates`
     button. This will clear all coordinates and you will have to start again  
  1. After you have introduced all the points, click in the `Go` button and the
     app will start to process the coordinates and will show the results in the
     `DATA OUTPUT` tab  

![Introducing parameters in the projection points mode](resources/projection_points_mode_01.png)

### Data output

After pressing the `Go` button the view will change to the `DATA OUTPUT` tab
automatically, whereas the progress of the interpolation and the correction is
showed.  

![Progress dialogue in the Projection Points mode](resources/projection_points_mode_02.png)

When it is finished we can see the time series for the different variables
predictions in the selected points. Again, you can zoom/unzoom to be able to
inspect the data more closely. Topography info of the selected points is also
shown. If all is ok the data can be downloaded clicking in the `Download` button
resulting in a `zip` file containing `txt` files for each point.

![Output data overview in the Projection Points mode](resources/projection_points_mode_03.png)

### Limitations

  1. Point selection limited to 10 points  
  2. No dates range available, all period up to 2100-12-01 is provided

As in the historical mode, processing the data can take several minutes, as all
the future projection is processed. Time for slacking off again!

### What's happening behind the curtains?

Here the app is working really hard for you. First we build the interpolator
object for the historical period as we did in the *Historical Points mode* to
have a reference for the correction step. After that we build the future
uncorrected data in a `MetereologicalUncorrectedData` object from the
regional climate model and the representative pathway concentration combination
selected and we retrieve the topography info for the selected points.
By means of the `meteoland::correctionpoints` function the future projection is
statistically corrected and the results are returned as a `SpatialMetereologyData`
object to visualize it.

\newpage

## **Historical Grid mode**

In this mode you will be able to interpolate a grid (rectangular area) in a
range of dates between 1976 and the las year, based on the available metereological
stations data inside and around (by a 30km buffer) the selected area.  

  1. Go to the `USER INPUT` tab  
  1. Select `Historical` and `Grid` in the left sidebar  
  1. Introduce the starting and ending dates of the period of interest (if you
     want to retrieve only one day, starting and ending date must be the same)  
  1. Select the area, as a two coordinates pair, the upper left pair and the
     bottom right pair describing the rectangle desired. You can do this in two
     ways:
      - Clicking in the map, first for the upper left limit and last for the
        bottom right limit. Coordinates values will appear in the boxes
      - Filling the both pairs of coordinates directly in the boxes  
  1. After you have introduced all the points, click in the `Go` button and the
     app will start to process the grid and will show the results in the
     `DATA OUTPUT` tab  

![Introducing parameters in the historical grid mode](resources/historical_grid_mode_01.png)

\newpage

## **Current Grid Mode**

Here you can interpolate data from the current year up to the actual date for
a rectangular grid, based on the available metereological stations data inside
and around (in a 30km buffer area) the selected area.  

### Data input

  1. Go to the `USER INPUT` tab  
  1. Select `Current` and `Grid` in the left sidebar  
  1. Introduce the starting and ending dates of the period of interest (if you
     want to retrieve only one day, starting and ending date must be the same)  
  1. Select the area, as a two coordinates pair, the upper left pair and the
     bottom right pair describing the rectangle desired. You can do this in two
     ways:
      - Clicking in the map, first for the upper left limit and last for the
        bottom right limit. Coordinates values will appear in the boxes
      - Filling the both pairs of coordinates directly in the boxes  
  1. After you have introduced all the points, click in the `Go` button and the
     app will start to process the grid and will show the results in the
     `DATA OUTPUT` tab  

![Introducing parameters in the current grid mode](resources/current_grid_mode_01_scaled.png)

### Data output

After the `Go` button is pressed and the data is processed, app will change to
the `DATA OUTPUT` tab automatically. Depending on the grid size, it can take a
while to process all the data.  

![Progress dialogue in the Current Grid mode](resources/current_grid_mode_02.png)

In the `DATA OUTPUT` tab you will find a grid plot showing the results for the
selected variable and date, which you can change in the right sidebar of the
tab. In order to download the data, if the `Download` button is pressed a `zip`
file will be generated, containing a `netCDF` file for each day of the dates
range selected (see the [ncdf4 package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ncdf4)
to read and acces the data from R).  

![Output overview of the Current Grid mode](resources/current_grid_mode_03.png)

### Limitations

1. Dates ranges limited to the available current year dates

### What's happening behind the curtains?

Here we *cheat* a little. Instead of processing grids, we have precalculated the
grid topography as spatial points, and from that the interpolation is made for
the points inside the grid provided in the `USER INPUT` tab. In this way the
interpolation is made with the `interpolationpoints` function (faster than
the grid equivalent function). After that a `SpatialMetereologyGrid` is created
and returned to visualize the results.  
Results are served as `netCDF` files, an standard file type for multidimensional
data.

\newpage

## **Projection Grid Mode**

In this case data are interpolated and downscaled from coarse
climate models projections (using both, historical and future data and including
a statistical correction) to the selected grid scale (1km^2^).  

### Data input

  1. Go to the `USER INPUT` tab  
  1. Select `Projection` and `Points` in the left sidebar  
  1. Select the desired combination of `Regional Climate Model` and
     `Representative Concentration Pathway`. In this case there is no date
     selection as all the future projection until 2100-12-01 is retrieved  
  1. Select the area, as a two coordinates pair, the upper left pair and the
     bottom right pair describing the rectangle desired. You can do this in two
     ways:
      - Clicking in the map, first for the upper left limit and last for the
        bottom right limit. Coordinates values will appear in the boxes
      - Filling the both pairs of coordinates directly in the boxes  
  1. If you want to clear the coordinates introduced, click the `Reset coordinates`
     button. This will clear all coordinates and you will have to start again  
  1. After you have introduced all the points, click in the `Go` button and the
     app will start to process the coordinates and will show the results in the
     `DATA OUTPUT` tab  

![Introducing parameters in the projection grid mode](resources/projection_grid_mode_01.png)

### Data output

For this mode only mean month values are returned, as doing it at day scale is
computationally expensive. So in this case the process will also take a while to
complete, as all months from 2006 to 2100 are processed.  

![Progress dialogue in the Projection Grid mode](resources/projection_grid_mode_02.png)

`DATA OUTPUT` tab is similar to the *Current Grid mode* one, as a grid plot
is presented for the selected variable and date (first day of the month in this
case). After clicking in the `Download` button an single `netCDF` file containing
all dates and metereological values for all variables is created and downloaded.  

![Output overview of the Projection Grid mode](resources/projection_grid_mode_03.png)

### Limitations

  1. Grid size is limited to a maximium size of 2500 km^2^  
  2. No date selection, all future projection is returned  

### What's happening behind the curtains?

Grid projections are expensive (in terms of processing and memory), so in this
case we have a precalculated grid for all Catalonia with the interpolated and
corrected values, so in this case we subset the precalculated grid and create
an `SpatialMetereologyGrid` object to visualize the results.
