Package `meteoland` can be found at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), where new versions are updated every 3-4 months. Users can download and install the latest stable versions GitHub as follows:

`devtools::install_github("miquelcaceres/meteoland")`

Required packages `devtools` and `curl` may be installed/updated first. Documentation on the models included in `meteoland` and how to run them using the package functions can be found below. Additionally, users can have help to run package functions directly as package vignettes, by forcing their inclusion in installation: 

`devtools::install_github("miquelcaceres/meteoland", build_vignettes=TRUE)`
